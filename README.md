🚧 **Project Status: Work In Progress (MVP Phase)** 🚧

**oh-my-github** is an AI-powered system that helps developers discover high-quality open source projects worth contributing to. It acts like a Venture Capital analyst, going beyond simple star counts to analyze project activity, contribution friendliness, and code quality.

## 🎯 Key Goals

- **Find "Alpha"**: Discover early-stage projects (100-5k stars) with strong growth momentum.
- **Analyze Friendliness**: Evaluate PR merge rates, issue response times, and maintainer engagement.
- **Deep Audits**: AI-driven analysis of architecture, test coverage, and onboarding difficulty.
- **Save Time**: Transform "mass browsing" into "precise matching".

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), Bun, Vercel AI SDK, TailwindCSS + Shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes (Edge Runtime), LangGraph.js
- **AI**: DeepSeek V3
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel, Upstash Redis

## 🚀 Getting Started
